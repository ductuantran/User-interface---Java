# User-interface---Java

This program implement a PhotoViewer in Java with JavaSwing.

The main idea is to create a program which allows us to import a photo, edit, add text or draw freely
on the back of the photo and remember all these modifications for the next importation of the frame.

The main challenge is that it is asked to implement all the drawings with basic components of JavaSwing 
as Canvas, Graphics2d, ... without using available graphical components.
